# MolStructSampling

This is a package for
- evaluating the joint probability density value of molecular wavefunctions written in a basis of complex explicitly correlated Gaussians,
- drawing random samples using Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo
- and analyzing the resulting sample.

Please see [our publication](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-mrxng) describing the research based on this package.
